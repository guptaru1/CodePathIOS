Being able to take a photo of skin and the app detecting if there are any abnormalities present/ giving a brief identification of what disease it could be. The app I envision is a skin disease detection application.
The features I would like to implement is implementing two users-> a patient and a doctor, once the photo is captured a machine learning model is running in the background to give the analysis before connecting the patient user with a specific doctor.
